# AQUICC (Air QUality In Climate Change)

AQUICC is the research project led by the Laboratory for Atmospheric Research group at Washington State University [WSU LAR](http://lar.wsu.edu/). We investigate the impact of global factors such as US anthropogenic emissions, Land Use and Land Cover changes and climate change on future air quality in the western US. We developed a computationally efficient Lagrangian box-scale air quality modeling framework to perform an ensemble analysis using statistically downscaled climate data.
