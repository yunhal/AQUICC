# AQUICC (Air QUality In Climate Change)

AQUICC is the research project led by the Laboratory for Atmospheric Research (LAR) group at Washington State University. We investigate the impact of global factors such as US anthropogenic emissions, Land Use and Land Cover changes and climate change on future air quality in the western US. We developed a computationally efficient Lagrangian box-scale air quality modeling framework to perform an ensemble analysis using statistically downscaled climate data.
